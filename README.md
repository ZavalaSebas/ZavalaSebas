## Hey, it's me — ZavalaSebas :)

Building things on the web. Breaking a few along the way.

### 🛠️ Current focus
- ⚙️ Exploring: Blazor (yup, still rocking C# on the frontend)
- 📦 Messing with: APIs, components, UI weirdness

### 💡 Stuff I enjoy
- Writing code that actually runs
- Minimal UIs, clean logic, and the occasional chaos

### 👨‍💻 Projects
You’ll mostly find:
- Blazor experiments
- Small tools and playgrounds
- UI experiments & components

### 📬 Reach out
If it's about code, collabs, or something random:
